# Kyrgyz_News_Corpus
The Kyrgyz News Corpus dataset is a collection of news in the Kyrgyz language collected from various news sites using web scraping and contains 256364 news.

This corpus contains news on various topics, including politics, economics, culture, sports and others. Each entry in the dataset is a separate news item, including the text and the source.

This dataset can only be used for research purposes such as natural language processing, thematic modeling, and more. It can be useful for researchers, developers and students interested in analyzing texts in the Kyrgyz language and related tasks.
